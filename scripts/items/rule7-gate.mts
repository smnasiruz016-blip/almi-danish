// Rule #7 gate — every exam×skill module must carry at least 15 practice items.
//
// The rule was policy from the start and was never enforced by a machine, so the bank
// drifted: all 20 modules sat under it, the worst at 3 items, and it survived a grader
// rebuild and a status-endpoint fix without anyone noticing. A rule that lives only in
// memory is not a rule, it is a hope. This runs in `build`, so it blocks.
//
// Two differences from the AlmiSwiss original this is modelled on:
//
//   1. It is WIRED. The Swiss check exists but sits behind an npm script nothing calls —
//      not in build, not in CI — so it fires only when a human remembers, which is the
//      same failure mode as the memory-only rule it was meant to replace.
//
//   2. An EMPTY module fails here. Swiss skips modules at 0 on the reasoning that
//      "empty is honest; half-full is not". That holds while a bank is being built out.
//      For a launched product every module is populated, so a count of 0 cannot mean
//      "not written yet" — it means the bundle is not being loaded. That is exactly the
//      orphan-bundle bug Swiss's own comments describe, where Rule #7 read 0 for a module
//      with 15 finished tasks and the only tell was a counter that did not move.
